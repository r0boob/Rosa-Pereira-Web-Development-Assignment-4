    <h2>
        Why Awareness Matters
    </h2>
    <p>
        I believe that cybersecurity is an essential skill in today's world.
        The purpose of this course is to inform everyday internet users about the 
        importance of security's best practices in the online world. <em>But how do we get
        through to people who could not care less about cybersecurity?</em> We try to make it
        fun through a series of interactive modules that help learners stay engaged. With 
        help from technologies employed (such as Canva and Canvas LMS) and 10
        carefully collected Scholarly Sources this course presents learners with 
        practical knowledge for daily digital safety.
