        This website talks about my capstone project: <strong>an educational
        cybersecurity awareness course hosted on Canvas LMS</strong> and designed for beginners.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course covers essential topics such as <em>current threats,
        mitigation strategies, and best security practices</em>. Modules
        are designed for beginners, so highly technical language is avoided, when 
        inevitable, all concepts are explained completely. The cyber survival guide 
        has interactive elements such as quizzes, scenario based challenges, reflection posts 
        and users are able to earn badges for every module or challenge that they
        successfully complete.
